        Thank you for your interest in downloading data from trase.earth! Trase is committed to making the data
        available on the platform publicly available for anyone to access and use. The data portal is currently
        deactivated whilst we put some finishing touches to its development. We plan to make it live before the
        end of August, when we will also be releasing the next version of the supply chain map for Brazilian soy
        exports, covering 2010-2016.
